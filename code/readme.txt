Certainly! Here's the provided code converted to pseudo code with a detailed explanation of each section:

```plaintext
1. Include necessary libraries: IoTkit, Ethernet, aJSON

2. Create an instance of the IoTkit class: iotkit

3. Define the analog input pin for the seismometer: seismoPin = A0

4. Initialize the program:
   a. Begin serial communication
   b. Call iotkit.begin() to initialize the IoTkit

5. Start the main loop:
   a. Read the analog value from the seismometer: seismograph = analogRead(seismoPin)
   b. Send the seismograph value to the IoTkit Cloud: iotkit.send(seismograph)
   c. Print the message "Temperature is" to the serial monitor
   d. Print the value of seismograph to the serial monitor
   e. Delay the execution for 30 minutes (1800000 milliseconds)

6. Define a callback function to handle incoming JSON data:
   a. Print the received JSON string to the serial monitor
   b. Parse the JSON string into a parsed JSON object: parsed = aJson.parse(json)
   c. Check if the parsed JSON object is valid and not empty
      i. If the JSON is invalid or empty, print the message "Received invalid JSON" and return
   d. Get the "component" and "command" items from the parsed JSON object
   e. Check if the "component" item is not null
      i. If the "component" is "led"
         i. Check if the "command" item is "off"
            i. Set pin 13 as an output
            ii. Turn off the LED by setting pin 13 to LOW
         ii. Check if the "command" item is "on"
            i. Set pin 13 as an output
            ii. Turn on the LED by setting pin 13 to HIGH

Explanation:
1. The required libraries are included to access the necessary functions and definitions for working with the Intel IoT Kit, Ethernet, and aJSON.

2. An instance of the `IoTkit` class is created, which will be used to interact with the IoTkit functionalities.

3. The `seismoPin` variable is defined to represent the analog input pin connected to the seismometer. The pin number should match the one used in the hardware setup.

4. The setup function is called, which performs the following tasks:
   - Initiates serial communication with a baud rate of 115200.
   - Initializes the IoTkit by calling `iotkit.begin()`.

5. The main loop is where the core logic of the program resides:
   - The analog value from the seismometer is read using `analogRead(seismoPin)` and stored in the `seismograph` variable.
   - The `send()` function of the `iotkit` object is called to send the `seismograph` value to the IoTkit Cloud.
   - The message "Temperature is" is printed to the serial monitor. (Note: This should be modified to match the correct sensor being used.)
   - The value of `seismograph` is printed to the serial monitor.
   - The program pauses for 30 minutes (1800000 milliseconds) before the loop repeats.

6. The `callback()` function is defined to handle any incoming JSON data from the cloud. It performs the following tasks:
   - The received JSON string is printed to the serial monitor.
   - The JSON string is parsed into a parsed JSON object using the `aJson.parse()` function.
   - It checks if the parsed JSON object is valid and not empty. If it is invalid
